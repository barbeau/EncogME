--== OVERVIEW ==--

A port of the Encog neural network project to Java Micro Edition, 
as well as supporting server-side projects that allow a neural network 
to be trained server-side, and then have the trained model extracted and 
transferred to the mobile phone for neural net execution in real-time on the mobile device.

--== PROJECT ARCHITECTURE ==--

Details about the Encog ME architecture are available on the website:

--== PROJECTS ==--

EncogCoreJavaME               - Core neural net code ported to Java Micro Edition
EncogDesktop                  - Testing desktop app used to produce neural net training and testing times in an desktop environment 
EncogJavaMEApp                - Java ME app, which implements a GUI and network communication with server on top of EncogCoreJavaME
EncogModelGenerator           - Destkop software used to train a neural network and store the trained model as XML in a database
wsEncogResults                - Glassfish web app project, which receives requests from EncogJavaMEApp for trained neural net models, retrieved the trained models from the database, and returns them to the mobile app
